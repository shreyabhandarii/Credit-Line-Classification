# Credi-Line-Classification

Background
XYZEE, a multinational financial services company decided to launch a premium credit card for businesses. Businesses use credit card as a payment enabler as well as to meet short term credit needs. XYZEE decided to offer this new card to its existing business card holders only. The credit card will offer a ton of benefits such as:
•	Access to airport lounges
•	5X membership reward points
•	Elite status at premium hotels
•	Access to premium golf courses
•	Extensive coverage across geographies
Given the benefits of the credit card, thousands of existing customers submitted their application forms for the credit card. Along with the data present in application forms and customers internal performance on their existing credit card relationships with the XYZEE, XYZEE also has access to the consumer bureau. Bureau is an agency that aggregates consumer borrowing and payment information which can be leveraged in assessing credit worthiness of an individual and setting a limit on the cumulative credit that can be extended to an individual by lenders. In order to extend the credit card to the individuals, XYZEE has to perform Initial Line Assignment.
Initial Line Assignment refers to the process through which credit line is¬¬ assigned to a new approved card lending account. The objective of initial line decision is to profitably accommodate cardholder’s spending and revolving needs while controlling the amount of write-off, thus ensuring the financial health of the card portfolio and card-member satisfaction.
Line, also referred to as a Credit Limit, is one of the most important features of a credit card. Line is communicated to the customer and allows them to manage how much they can borrow on a single credit card account.
Line is a key component of the economics of a lending business. It drives profitability and customer satisfaction.
Line impacts profitability in the following ways:
•	Higher lines can drive higher spend and balance
•	Higher lines will drive higher write-offs
XYZEE has hired you to predict with level of line category (low, medium, High) for each applicant as per its need and credit worthiness. XYZEE will leverage this categorization in order to come up with the actual lines for each application. XYZEE has provided you with the customer application, customer internal performance data with line categorization on existing cards. XYZEE’s expectation from you is to predict the level of credit line of an applicant in terms of low, medium and high.
Customer internal performance data comprise of spend on existing cards, line on existing card, predicted risk for existing card accounts, revolve balance etc.
